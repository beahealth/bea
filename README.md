# Bea period tracker app
We believe that people should have control of their health data, so we're building an open source period tracker app that's aimed at data privacy.
None of your health data ever leaves your your device, so we can't be subpoenaed for any information about you.

## Tech details
We're using Expo/React Native for native support on both iOS and Android.

## How to help
We need help! We're looking for React/React Native developers, UI/UX designers, marketers, and more.
### Not technical? 
You can still help! Spread the word on social media or consider leaving a donation to help offset costs.
